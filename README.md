In this final project I will attempt to create a place where you can look at map and see where the best places to poop are. It will show user-placed destinations and then you can review a place to poop with stars in different categories. This will make pooping in public places a lot easier and safer. It's like Yelp but for toilets! 
Due to time constraints, it's not 100 percent complete but I learned a lot about Swift in the process. If it was finished, it probably would've been in the Top 5 apps in the Apple App Store.
Got help from AppStuff for the menu
